# Content-Aware Caching and Scheduling for Transformer Model Serving

March 31st 2025 @ Rotterdam, The Netherlands

Held in conjunction with [ASPLOS 2025](https://www.asplos-conference.org/asplos2025/)

### About

The increasing deployment of transformer models in production environments has revealed fundamental challenges in traditional caching and scheduling approaches that treat all requests equally. This workshop focuses on the emerging paradigm of content-aware system design for transformer serving, where caching decisions and scheduling policies are guided by the semantic patterns and computational characteristics of incoming requests adaptively. As transformer applications span from simple queries to complex chain-of-thought reasoning and RAG-enhanced processing, the variance in resource requirements and execution patterns demands more sophisticated serving strategies.

CAT-Serve brings together researchers and practitioners to explore novel approaches that leverage request content understanding for system optimization.

### Important Dates

-   Paper submission: **February 9, 2025 ~~February 2, 2025~~**
-   Author Notification: **Febuary 21, 2025**
-   Camera-ready version: **March 23, 2025**
-   Workshop: **March 31, 2025**

All deadlines are AOE 11:59pm.

### Call for Papers

CAT-Serve emphasizes solutions that bridge hardware capabilities, system software, and ML serving frameworks to enable intelligent resource management.

Topics include, but not limited to:

-   Semantic-aware cache replacement policies
-   Workload-adaptive scheduling algorithms
-   Content-based resource prediction
-   Cross-request optimization opportunities

Aiming to find novel ways to:

-   Improve serving efficiency
-   Reduce tail latency
-   Enable better resource utilization across power, computing, and memory domains
-   All spanning diverse transformer workloads in single and multi-tenant environments

### Submission Guidelines

- CAT-Serve welcomes submissions of short papers, up to 3 pages excluding references, using a double-column format. You can use [this Latex template](CATServe2025_paper_template.tex).
- Submissions should state the research problem, motivation, and technical contribution. All submissions must be in English. The submissions should be sent in a single PDF file.
- Papers can present work in progress, exploratory/preliminary research or already published work.
- Submissions will be assessed based on their novelty, technical quality, potential impact, interest, clarity, relevance, and reproducibility.
- Reviews will not be blind, so please submit without anonymizing authors in the submitted PDF.
- There will be no formal proceedings, allowing authors the flexibility to extend and publish their work in other conferences and journals.
- For each accepted paper, at least one author must attend the workshop and present the paper.
